Project for subject Numerical Algorithms and Numerical Software

The goal of the project was to learn about physical simulations and make a simple 2D game engine.
The project was made using python with pygame for UI and numpy for implementing all algorithms.

- Game objects are circles and polygons
- Forces that are modeled for every object are gravity and air resistance
- The game engine uses 4th order Runge - Kutta method to approximate the velocity and position of game objects
- Collision detection is implemented with GJK + EPA algorithm
- Colision is modeled as elastic
